  <p>Before you start to learn to drive on the road, you’ll need to get a learner's licence.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Who Can Apply for a License?</h4>
  <p>Anyone who is at least 16 years old can apply for a learner license.</p>
  <h5>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h5>
  <h4>Learner License Conditions / Rules</h4>
  <p>- You Must always display L (learner) plates on your car. Commonly located at the front and rear of your car. 
  <br>
  - You are allowed to carry passengers in your car, but only with your supervisor’s agreement. Your supervisor is responsible for everyone in the car and for what happens while you’re driving.
  <br>
  - You are not allowed to drive alone, you must have a supervisor in the front passenger seat of the car. 
  <br> 
  If you break the learner conditions of your driver's licence, you could get 25 to 35 demerit points and receive a $100 fine.</p>
  /*LINK*/ <p>What are Demerit Points?</p>
  <h4>What is a Supervisor?</h4>
  <p>A supervisor is someone who: 
  <br>
  - holds a current and valid full New Zealand licence for the class of vehicle, and 
  - doesn’t have a supervisor condition on their New Zealand licence, and 
  - has held the full New Zealand licence for at least 2 years OR has held an equivalent overseas licence for at least 2 years. 
  <br> 
  They must always sit in the passenger seat next to you when you’re driving, and they must carry their driver licence with them.</p>
  <h5>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h5>
  <h4>L Plates</h4>
  <p>If you’re driving with a class 1 or class 6 learner licence, you must display L plates on your vehicle. 
  <br>
  L plates allow other road users that you're a learner driver and help police officers make sure learner drivers are following their learner licence conditions. 
  <br>
  The L plate must have a black L on a yellow background and must be no smaller than the measurements shown on the diagram below.</p>
  /*Insert photo of measurements*/
  <p> If you’re driving a car, van or ute, your L plates:
  <br>
  - Must be displayed on both the front and rear of the vehicle. 
  - Must be visible to other road users must not restrict your front or rear vision. 
  - If you’re riding a moped, you must display an L plate on the back of your moped. 
  <br>
  You can buy L plates from driver licensing agents </p>
